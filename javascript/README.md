Maps Engine Javascript Samples
==============================
This repository hosts a sample written in Javascript for Google Maps Engine.  
The code from this sample is included directly into the [Maps Engine 
documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps-engine/).


Map Upload and Publish (gme-publish)
====================================

This sample demonstrates how to upload GIS style point data to Maps Engine as
a vector table, create and publish a layer out of the table, 
then create a map from the layer and publish it.

To run this sample, first modify the `clientId` and `apiKey` with values 
created by following the directions on [Register your 
Application](https://developers.google.com/maps-engine/documentation/register). 
Then, publish the HTML and Javascript files on a web server of your choice. 

When you access the web page from a browser, you will be asked firstly to
authorise the application to act on your behalf for Google Maps Engine API. 
Then you will need to select a GME API Project for this script to publish 
it's data into. You will then be shown the full HTTP conversation between 
your browser and the Maps Engine API endpoints.

List Table Features (gme-list-table-features)
=============================================

This simple sample demonstrates how to retrieve the features of a published 
table, with the minimum of ceremony. 

To run this sample, first modify the `clientId` and `apiKey` with values 
created by following the directions on [Register your 
Application](https://developers.google.com/maps-engine/documentation/register). 
Then, publish the HTML and Javascript files on a web server of your choice.
